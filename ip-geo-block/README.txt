It blocks any spams, login attempts and malicious access to the admin area 
posted from the specific countries, and also prevents zero-day exploit.

== Description ==

There're some cases of a site being infected. The first one is the case that 
contaminated files are uploaded via FTP or something. In this case, scaning 
and verifing integrity of files in the site is needed to detect the infection.

The second one is cracking of the login username and password. In this case, 
the rule of right is to strengthen the password.

The third one may be caused by malicious accesses to the core files. The major 
issue in this case is that a plugin or theme in your site can potentially has 
some vulnerability such as XSS, CSRF, SQLi, LFI and so on. For example, if a 
plugin has Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, the attackers can easily 
download the `wp-config.php` by simply hitting 
    [wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=show&file=../wp-config.php](http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/09/slider-revolution-plugin-critical-vulnerability-being-exploited.html "Slider Revolution Plugin Critical Vulnerability Being Exploited | Sucuri Blog")
on their browser instead of cracking username and password.

For these cases, the protection based on the IP address is not a perfect 
solution for everyone. But for some site owners or some certain cases such 
as 'zero-day attack', combination with the original feature 'Zero-day Exploit 
Prevention' can reduce the risk of infection against the specific attacks.

That's why this plugin is here.

= Features =

This plugin will examine a country code based on the IP address. If a 
comment, pingback or trackback comes from the specific country, it can be 
blocked before Akismet validate it.

With the same mechanism, it fights against burst accesses by brute-force 
and reverse-brute-force attacks to the login form and XML-RPC.

* **Immigration control:**  
  Access to the basic and important entrances into the back-end such as 
  `wp-comments-post.php`, `xmlrpc.php`, `wp-login.php`, `wp-signup.php`, 
  `wp-admin/admin.php`, `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`, `wp-admin/admin-post.php` 
  will be validated by means of a country code based on IP address. It allows 
  you to configure either whitelist or blacklist to specify the countires.

* **Zero-day Exploit Prevention:**  
  The original feature "**Z**ero-day **E**xploit **P**revention for WP" 
  (WP-ZEP) is simple but still smart and strong enough to block any malicious 
  accesses to `wp-admin/*.php`, `plugins/*.php` and `themes/*.php` even from 
  the permitted countries. It will protect your site against certain types of 
  attack such as CSRF, LFI, SQLi, XSS and so on, **even if you have some 
    [vulnerable plugins or themes](https://wpvulndb.com/ "WPScan Vulnerability Database")
  in your site**. Find more details in 
    [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ip-geo-block/faq/ "IP Geo Block - WordPress Plugins")
  and 
    [this plugin's blog](http://www.ipgeoblock.com/article/how-wpzep-works.html "How does WP-ZEP prevent zero-day attack? | IP Geo Block").

* **Guard against login attempts:**  
  In order to prevent the invasion through the login form and XML-RPC by 
  the brute-force and the reverse-brute-force attacks, the number of login 
  attempts will be limited per IP address even from the permitted countries.

* **Protection of wp-config.php:**  
  A malicious request to try to expose `wp-config.php` via vulnerable plugins 
  or themes can be blocked. A numerous such attacks can be found in 
    [this article](http://www.ipgeoblock.com/article/exposure-of-wp-config-php.html "Prevent exposure of wp-config.php").

* **Support of BuddyPress and bbPress:**  
  You can configure this plugin such that a registered user can login as the
  membership from anywhere, but a request such as a new user registration,
  lost password, creating a new topic, and subscribing comment is blocked by 
  the country code. It is suitable for
    [BuddyPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/ "WordPress › BuddyPress « WordPress Plugins")
    and [bbPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/ "WordPress › bbPress « WordPress Plugins")
  to help reducing spams.

* **Referrer suppressor for external links:**  
  When you click an external hyperlink on admin screen, http referrer will be 
  eliminated to hide a footprint of your site.

* **Multiple source of IP Geolocation databases:**  
  Free IP Geolocation database and REST APIs are installed into this plugin to
  get a country code from an IP address. There are two types of API which 
  support only IPv4 or both IPv4 and IPv6. This plugin will automatically 
  choose an appropriate API.

* **Database auto updater:**  
  [MaxMind](http://www.maxmind.com "MaxMind - IP Geolocation and Online Fraud Prevention") 
  GeoLite free databases and 
  [IP2Location](http://www.ip2location.com/ "IP Address Geolocation to Identify Website Visitor's Geographical Location") 
  LITE databases can be incorporated with this plugin. Those will be downloaded
  and updated (once a month) automatically.

* **Cache mechanism:**  
  A cache mechanism for the fetched IP addresses and country code has been 
  equipped to reduce load on the server against the burst accesses with a 
  short period of time.

* **Customizing response:**  
  HTTP response code can be selectable as `403 Forbidden` to deny access pages,
  `404 Not Found` to hide pages or even `200 OK` to redirect to the top page.
  You can also have the custom error page (for example `403.php`) in your theme
  template directory or child theme directory to fit your theme.

* **Validation logs:**  
  Logs will be recorded into MySQL data table to audit posting pattern under 
  the specified condition.

* **Cooperation with full spec security plugin:**  
  This plugin is simple and lite enough to be able to cooperate with other 
  full spec security plugin such as 
    [Wordfence Security](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/ "WordPress › Wordfence Security « WordPress Plugins")
  (because the function of country bloking is available only for premium users).

* **Extendability:**  
  "Settings minimum, Customizability maximum" is the basic concept of this 
  plugin. You can customize the behavior of this plugin via `add_filter()`
  with pre-defined filter hook. See various use cases in 
    [the documents](http://www.ipgeoblock.com/codex/ "Codex | IP Geo Block")
  and 
    [samples.php](https://github.com/tokkonopapa/WordPress-IP-Geo-Block/blob/master/ip-geo-block/samples.php "WordPress-IP-Geo-Block/samples.php at master - tokkonopapa/WordPress-IP-Geo-Block - GitHub")
  bundled within this package.

* **Self blocking prevention and easy rescue:**  
  Most of users do not prefer themselves to be blocked. This plugin prevents 
  such a sad thing unless you force it.
    ([release 2.1.4](http://www.ipgeoblock.com/changelog/release-2.1.4.html "2.1.4 Release Note"))
  And futhermore, if such a situation occurs, you can rescue yourself easily.
    ([release 2.1.3](http://www.ipgeoblock.com/changelog/release-2.1.3.html "2.1.3 Release Note"))

* **Clean uninstallation:**  
  Nothing is left in your precious mySQL database after uninstallation. So you
  can feel free to install and activate to make a trial of this plugin's
  functionality. Several days later, you'll find many undesirable accesses in
  your validation logs if all validation targets are enabled.

= Development =

Development of this plugin is promoted on 
    [GitHub](https://github.com/tokkonopapa/WordPress-IP-Geo-Block "tokkonopapa/WordPress-IP-Geo-Block - GitHub").
All contributions will always be welcome. Or visit my 
    [development blog](http://www.ipgeoblock.com/ "IP Geo Block").

== Installation ==

= Using The WordPress Dashboard =

1. Navigate to the 'Add New' in the plugins dashboard
2. Search for 'IP Geo Block'
3. Click 'Install Now'
4. Activate the plugin on the Plugin dashboard

= Validation rule settings =

* **Matching rule**  
  Choose either `White list` (recommended) or `Black list` to specify the 
  countries from which you want to pass or block.

* **Country code for matching rule**  
  Specify the country code with two letters (see 
    [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements "ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia")
  ). Each of them should be separated by comma.

* **White/Black list of extra IPs for prior validation**  
  The list of extra IP addresses prior to the validation of country code.
  [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing "Classless Inter-Domain Routing - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia")
  is acceptable to specify the range.

* **$_SERVER keys for extra IPs**  
  Additional IP addresses will be validated if some of keys in `$_SERVER` 
  variable are specified in this textfield. Typically `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR`.

* **Bad signatures in query**
  It validates malicious signatures independently of **Block by country** and 
  **Prevent Zero-day Exploit** for the target **Admin area**, 
  **Admin ajax/post**, **Plugins area** and **Themes area**.
  Typically, `/wp-config.php` and `/passwd`.

* **Response code**  
  Choose one of the 
    [response code](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10 "RFC 2616 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1")
  to be sent when it blocks a comment.
  The 2xx code will lead to your top page, the 3xx code will redirect to 
    [Black Hole Server](http://blackhole.webpagetest.org/),
  the 4xx code will lead to WordPress error page, and the 5xx will pretend 
  an server error.

= Validation target settings =

* **Comment post**  
  Validate post to `wp-comment-post.php`. Comment post and trackback will be 
  validated.

* **XML-RPC**  
  Validate access to `xmlrpc.php`. Pingback and other remote command with 
  username and password will be validated.

* **Login form**  
  Validate access to `wp-login.php` and `wp-signup.php`.

* **Admin area**  
  Validate access to `wp-admin/*.php`.

* **Admin ajax/post**  
  Validate access to `wp-admin/admin-(ajax|post)*.php`.

* **Plugins area**  
  Validate direct access to plugins. Typically `wp-content/plugins/…/*.php`.

* **Themes area**  
  Validate direct access to themes. Typically `wp-content/themes/…/*.php`.

= Geolocation API settings =

* **API selection and key settings**  
  If you wish to use `IPInfoDB`, you should register at 
    [their site](http://ipinfodb.com/ "IPInfoDB | Free IP Address Geolocation Tools") 
  to get a free API key and set it into the textfield. And `ip-api.com` and 
  `Smart-IP.net` require non-commercial use.

= Local database settings settings =

* **Auto updating (once a month)**  
  If `Enable`, Maxmind GeoLite database will be downloaded automatically by 
  WordPress cron job.

= Record settings =

* **Record validation statistics**  
  If `Enable`, you can see `Statistics of validation` on Statistics tab.

* **Record validation logs**  
  If you choose anything but `Disable`, you can see `Validation logs` on 
  Logs tab.

* **$_POST keys in logs**  
  Normally, you can see just keys at `$_POST data:` on Logs tab. If you put 
  some of interested keys into this textfield, you can see the value of key 
  like `key=value`.

* **Anonymize IP address**  
  It will mask the last three digits of IP address when it is recorded into 
  the log.

= Cache settings =

* **Number of entries**  
  Maximum number of IPs to be cached.

* **Expiration time [sec]**  
  Maximum time in sec to keep cache.

= Submission settings =

* **Text position on comment form**  
  If you want to put some text message on your comment form, please choose
  `Top` or `Bottom` and put text with some tags into the **Text message on 
  comment form** textfield.

= Plugin settings =

* **Remove settings at uninstallation**  
  If you checked this option, all settings will be removed when this plugin
  is uninstalled for clean uninstalling.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I was locked down. What shall I do? =

Activate the following codes at the bottom of `ip-geo-block.php` and upload 
it via FTP.

`/**
 * Invalidate blocking behavior in case yourself is locked out.
 * @note: activate the following code and upload this file via FTP.
 */ /* -- EDIT THIS LINE AND ACTIVATE THE FOLLOWING FUNCTION -- */
function ip_geo_block_emergency( $validate ) {
    $validate['result'] = 'passed';
    return $validate;
}
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-login', 'ip_geo_block_emergency' );
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-admin', 'ip_geo_block_emergency' );
// */`

Then "**Clear cache**" at "**Statistics**" tab on your dashborad. Remember 
that you should upload the original one to deactivate above feature.

[This release note](http://www.ipgeoblock.com/changelog/release-2.1.3.html "2.1.3 Release Note")
can also help you.

= How can I fix "Unable to write" error? =

When you enable "**Force to load WP core**" options, this plugin will try to 
configure `.htaccess` in your `/wp-content/plugins/` and `/wp-content/themes/` 
directory in order to protect your site against the malicous attacks to the 
[OMG plugins and shemes](http://www.ipgeoblock.com/article/exposure-of-wp-config-php.html "Prevent exposure of wp-config.php | IP Geo Block").

But some servers doesn't give reading / writing permission against `.htaccess` 
to WordPress. In this case, you can configure these `.htaccess` files by your 
own hand instead of enabling "**Force to load WP core**" options.

Please refer to 
"[How can I fix permission troubles?](http://www.ipgeoblock.com/codex/how-can-i-fix-permission-troubles.html 'How can I fix permission troubles? | IP Geo Block')"
in order to fix this error.

= Do I have to turn on all the selection to enhance security? =

Yes. Roughly speaking, the strategy of this plugin has been constructed as 
follows:

- **Block by country**  
  It blocks malicious requests from outside your country.

- **Prevent Zero-day Exploit**  
  It blocks malicious requests from your country.

- **Force to load WP core**  
  It blocks the request which has not been covered in the above two.

- **Bad signatures in query**  
  It blocks the request which has not been covered in the above three.

See more details in 
"[The best practice of target settings](http://www.ipgeoblock.com/codex/the-best-practice-of-target-settings.html 'The best practice of target settings | IP Geo Block')".

= Does this plugin validate all the requests to the server? =

Unfortunately, no. This plugin can't handle the requests that are not 
parsed by WordPress. In other words, a standalone file (PHP, CGI or 
something excutable) that is unrelated to WordPress can't be validated 
by this plugin even if it is is in the WordPress install directory.

But there're exceptions: When you enable "**Force to load WP core**" for 
**Plugins area** or **Themes area**, a standalone PHP file becomes to be 
able to be blocked. Sometimes this kind of file in a plugin or theme has 
vulnerability. This function is provided against such a case.

= How can I test this plugin works? =

The easiest way is to use 
  [free proxy browser addon](https://www.google.com/search?q=free+proxy+browser+addon "free proxy browser addon - Google Search").
Another one is to use 
  [http header browser addon](https://www.google.com/search?q=browser+add+on+modify+http+header "browser add on modify http header - Google Search").
You can add an IP address to the `X-Forwarded-For` header to emulate the 
access behind the proxy. In this case, you should add `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` 
into the "**$_SERVER keys for extra IPs**" on "**Settings**" tab.

See more details in 
"[Using VPN browser addon](http://www.ipgeoblock.com/codex/using-vpn-browser-addon.html 'Using VPN browser addon | IP Geo Block')"
and
"[Using WordPress post simulator](http://www.ipgeoblock.com/codex/using-post-simulator.html 'Using WordPress post simulator | IP Geo Block')".

= Some admin function doesn't work when WP-ZEP is enabled. =

There are a few cases that WP-ZEP would not work. One is redirection at server 
side (caused by PHP or `.htaccess`) and client side (caused by JavaScript 
location object or meta tag for refresh).

Another is the case related to the content type. This plugin will only support 
 `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data`.

The other case is that a ajax/post request comes from not jQuery but flash or 
something.

In those cases, this plugin should bypass WP-ZEP. So please find the unique 
strings in the requested queries and add it into the safe query list via the 
filter hook `ip-geo-block-bypass-admins`.

If you can not figure out your troubles, please let me know about the plugin 
you are using at the support forum.

= Are there any other useful filter hooks? =

Yes, here is the list of all hooks to extend the feature of this plugin.

* `ip-geo-block-ip-addr`          : IP address of accessor.
* `ip-geo-block-headers`          : compose http request headers.
* `ip-geo-block-comment`          : validate IP address at `wp-comments-post.php`.
* `ip-geo-block-xmlrpc`           : validate IP address at `xmlrpc.php`.
* `ip-geo-block-login`            : validate IP address at `wp-login.php`.
* `ip-geo-block-admin`            : validate IP address at `wp-admin/*.php`.
* `ip-geo-block-extra-ips`        : white/black list of extra IPs for prior validation.
* `ip-geo-block-xxxxxx-status`    : http response status code for comment|xmlrpc|login|admin.
* `ip-geo-block-xxxxxx-reason`    : http response reason      for comment|xmlrpc|login|admin.
* `ip-geo-block-bypass-admins`    : array of admin queries which should bypass WP-ZEP.
* `ip-geo-block-bypass-plugins`   : array of plugin name which should bypass WP-ZEP.
* `ip-geo-block-bypass-themes`    : array of theme name which should bypass WP-ZEP.
* `ip-geo-block-backup-dir`       : full path where log files should be saved.
* `ip-geo-block-api-dir`          : full path to the API class libraries and local DB files.
* `ip-geo-block-maxmind-dir`      : full path where Maxmind GeoLite DB files should be saved.
* `ip-geo-block-maxmind-zip-ipv4` : url to Maxmind GeoLite DB zip file for IPv4.
* `ip-geo-block-maxmind-zip-ipv6` : url to Maxmind GeoLite DB zip file for IPv6.
* `ip-geo-block-ip2location-dir`  : full path where IP2Location LITE DB files should be saved.

Sorry for frequent update again but the following obvious bugs should be fixed.

* **Bug fix:** Fixed the issue of not initializing country code at activation.
* **Bug fix:** Fixed the issue that scheme less notation like '//example.com' 
  could not be handled correctly.

= 2.2.2.2 =
Sorry for frequent update.

* **Bug fix:** Fixed the issue of race condition at activation. This fix is 
  related to the urgent security update at **2.2.2.1 which was not actually
  the security issue but a bug**.
  See [this thread](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/white-list-hack "white list hack")
  about little more details.
* **Improvement:** Improved the compatibility with Jetpack.

= 2.2.2.1 =
* **Urgent security update:** Killed the possibility of the options being 
  altered.

= 2.2.2 =
* **Enhancement:** Refactored some codes and components. The number of attacks 
  that can be proccessed per second has been improved by 25% at the maximum.
* **Improvement:** In the previous version, the statistical data was recorded 
  into `wp_options`. It caused the uncertainty of recording especially in case 
  of burst attacks. Now the data will be recorded in an independent table to 
  improve this issue.
* **Bug fix:** Fixed conflict with NextGEN Gallary Pro.
  Thanks to [bodowewer](https://wordpress.org/support/profile/bodowewer).
* **Bug fix:** Fixed some filter hooks that did not work as intended.

= 2.2.1.1 =
* **Bug fix:** Fixed "open_basedir restriction" issue caused by `file_exists()`.

= 2.2.1 =
* **Enhancement:** In previous version, local geolocation databases will always
  be removed and downloaded again at every upgrading. Now, the class library 
  for Maxmind and IP2Location have become independent of this plugin and you 
  can put them outside this plugin in order to cut the above useless process.
  The library can be available from 
  [WordPress-IP-Geo-API](https://github.com/tokkonopapa/WordPress-IP-Geo-API).
* **Deprecated:** Cooperation with IP2Location plugins such as 
  [IP2Location Tags](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ip2location-tags/ "WordPress - IP2Location Tags - WordPress Plugins"),
  [IP2Location Variables](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ip2location-variables/ "WordPress - IP2Location Variables - WordPress Plugins"),
  [IP2Location Country Blocker](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ip2location-country-blocker/ "WordPress - IP2Location Country Blocker - WordPress Plugins")
  is out of use. Instead of it, free [IP2Location LITE databases for IPv4 and 
  IPv6](http://lite.ip2location.com/ "Free IP Geolocation Database") will be 
  downloaded.
* **Improvement:** Improved connectivity with Jetpack.
* **Improvement:** Improved immediacy of downloading databases at upgrading.
* **Improvement:** Replaced a terminated RESTful API service with a new stuff.
* **Bug fix:** Fixed issue that clicking a link tag without href always 
  refreshed the page. Thanks to 
  [wyclef](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/conflict-with-menu-editor-plugin "WordPress › Support » Conflict with Menu Editor plugin?").
* **Bug fix:** Fixed issue that deactivating and activating repeatedly caused 
  to show the welcome message.
* **Bug fix:** Fixed issue that a misaligned argument in the function caused 
  500 internal server error when a request to the php files in plugins/themes 
  area was rewrited to `rewrite.php`.

= 2.2.0.1 =
Sorry for frequent update.

* **Fix:** Fixed the issue that some actions of other plugins were blocked.

= 2.2.0 =
* **Important:** Now **Block by country** and **Prevent Zero-day Exploit** 
  become to work independently on **Admin area**, **Admin ajax/post** at 
  **Validation target settings**. Please reconfirm them.
* **Important:** Previously, a request whose country code can't be available 
  was always blocked. But from this release, such a request is considered as 
  comming from the country whose code is `ZZ`. It means that you can put `ZZ` 
  into the white list and black list.
* **New feature:** White list and Black list of extra IP addresses prior to 
  the validation of country code. Thanks to Fabiano for good suggestions at 
  [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/white-list-of-ip-addresses-or-ranges "WordPress › Support » White list of IP addresses or ranges?")
* **New feature:** Malicious signatures to prevent disclosing the important 
  files via vulnerable plugins or themes. A malicious request to try to expose

  **Anonymize IP address** at **Record settings**.

  [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/hackers-from-country-in-blocked-list-of-countries-trying-to-login "WordPress › Support » Hackers from country in Blocked List of Countries trying to login").

= 2.1.5 =
* **Enhancement:** Enforce preventing self blocking at the first installation.
  And add the scan button to get all the country code using selected API.

* **Bug fix:** Fix the issue that this plugin broke functionality of a certain 
  plugin. Thanks to **opsec** for reporting this issue at 
  [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/blocks-saves-in-types-or-any-plugins-from-wp-typescom "WordPress › Support » Blocks saves in Types or any plugins from wp-types.com").
* **Improvement:** Add checking process for validation rule to prevent being 
  blocked itself. Thanks to **internationals** for proposing at 
  [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/locked-out-due-to-eu-vs-country "WordPress › Support » Locked out due to EU vs. Country")
* **Improvement:** Arrage the order of setting sections to focus the goal of 
  this plugin.

  in case yourself is locked out. This feature is commented out by default at 
  the bottom of `ip-geo-block.php`.

  users logged in.

This is a maintenance release.

* **Bug fix:** Fix the issue that the login-fail-counter didn't work when the 
  validation at `Login form` was `block by country (register, lost password)`.
  In this release, the login-fail-counter works correctly.
* **Bug fix:** Fix the issue that the validation settings of `Admin area` and 
  `Admin ajax/post` were influential with each other. Now each of those works 
  individually.
* **Bug fix:** "Site Stats" of Jetpack is now shown on the admin bar which 
  issue was reported on [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/admin-area-prevent-zero-day-exploit-incompatible-with-jetpack-site-stats-in-a "WordPress › Support » Admin area - Prevent zero-day exploit: Incompatible with Jetpack Site Stats in A").
* **Improvement:** Hide checking the existence of log db behind the symbol 
  `IP_GEO_BLOCK_DEBUG` to reduce 1 query on admin screen.
* **Improvement:** Add alternative functions of BCMath extension to avoid 
  `PHP Fatal error: Call to undefined function` in `IP2Location.php` when 
  IPv6 is specified.
* **Improvement:** Use MaxMind database at the activating process not to be 
  locked out by means of inconsistency of database at the activation and after.
* See more details at [2.1.2 release note](http://www.ipgeoblock.com/changelog/release-2.1.2.html "2.1.2 Release Note").

= 2.1.1 =
* **New feature:** Added `Block by country (register, lost password)` at 
  `Login form` on `Settings` tab in order to accept the registered users as 
  membership from anywhere but block the request of new user ragistration and 
  lost password by the country code. Is't suitable for BuddyPress and bbPress.
* **Improvement:** Added showing the custom error page for http response code 
  4xx and 5xx. For example the `403.php` in the theme template directory or in 
  the child theme directory is used if it exists. And new filter hooks 
  `ip-geo-block-(comment|xmlrpc|login|admin)-(status|reason)` are available 
  to customize the response code and reason for human.
* **Obsoleted:** Obsoleted the filter hooks 
  `ip-geo-block-(admin-actions|admin-pages|wp-content)`. Alternatively new 
  filter hooks `ip-geo-block-bypass-(admins|plugins|themes)` are added to 
  bypass WP-ZEP.

  [example](https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/08/database-takeover-in-custom-contact-forms.html "Critical Vulnerability Disclosed on WordPress Custom Contact Forms Plugin")
  ) could not be blocked by the reason that some plugins accept it on earlier
