I know [IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block] still has some compatibility issues between
2.2.9.1 and 3.0.0. So I've dedicated my time and energy in solving them. In this
release note, I'd introduce some of them that have been solved along with some 
new features.

<!--more-->

### New feature: Exceptions for Admin ajax/post ###

The most frequent claim I've received in [support forum][SupportForum] is 
undesired blocking against some admin jobs on dashboard especially when you 
enable "[**Prevent Zero-day Exploit**][WP-ZEP]" named "WP-ZEP".

![Undesired blocking]({{ '/img/2017-03/AdminBlocking.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Undesired blocking"
)

Most of the cases can be solved by applying custom filter hook 
[`ip-geo-block-bypass-admins`][BypassAdmin] to bypass WP-ZEP. But you have to 
find the blocked pages or actions on "**Logs**" tab. Then you also have to put 
some awkward code snippet into the `functions.php`.

![Blocked request in logs]({{ '/img/2017-03/BlockedRequestLogs.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Blocked request in logs"
)

From this release, you can just pick up actions in "**Exceptions**" at 
"**Admin ajax/post**" in order to avoid undesired blocking instead of tweaking 
your `functions.php`.

![Exceptions for Admin ajax/post]({{ '/img/2017-03/AdminExceptions.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Exceptions for Admin ajax/post"
)

Note that if you check an action that has only locked icon <span class="emoji">
![emoji]({{ '/img/2017-03/LockedIcon.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})</span>,
"**Prevent Zero-day Exploit**" will be bypassed while "**Block by country**"
will be still in effective. And in case you check an action that has unlocked 
icon <span class="emoji">
![emoji]({{ '/img/2017-03/UnlockedIcon.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})</span>,
"**Block by country**" will be bypassed.

Even both cases, the validation of "**Bad signature**" is still in effective.

### Improvement: Disabling limit login attempts ###

In the previous version, when you enabled "**Block by country**" for "**Login 
form**", limiting the number of login attempts was also enabled, and the lock 
out period would be the same as of the cache of IP address (1 hour by default).
So you could not configure the expiry period individually.

Now, you can disable "limit login attempts" of this plugin so that you can use 
other preferred plugin.

![Max number of failed login attempts]({{ '/img/2017-03/FailedLoginAttempts.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Max number of failed login attempts"
)

### Improvement: Download link of geolocation DB ###

There were also issues related to the failure of downloading geolocation DBs.
For your convenience against such cases, the links to the download pages are 
added so that you can manually download them easily by your self.

![Download link of geolocation database]({{ '/img/2017-03/LocalDBSettings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Download link of geolocation database"
)

### Trial feature: Action hook ip-geo-block-send-sesponse ###

Action hook `ip-geo-block-send-sesponse` will be called just before sending 
HTTP status code and message when blocking happens.

{% highlight ruby %}
/**
 * @param string $hook        "comment", "login", "xmlrpc", "admin", "public"
 * @param int    $status_code HTTP status code
 * @param array  $validation  "ip": IP address, "code": country code, "result": blocking reason
 */
do_action( 'ip-geo-block-send-response', $hook, $status_code, $validation );
{% endhighlight %}

This can be used to send message via [syslog][PHP-syslog] so that it can be 
notified by [fail2ban][fail2ban] to add rules into the system firewall like 
[iptables][iptables].

{% highlight ruby %}
function my_send_response( $hook, $status_code, $validation ) {
    syslog( LOG_NOTICE, ... );
}
add_action( 'ip-geo-block-send-response', 'my_send_response' );
{% endhighlight %}

As with [WP fail2ban][WP-fail2ban], this feature has a huge potential for 
expansion so as to massively reduce the load on your server. So I'll provide 
an official support in the future!

### Need your cooperation ###

Please feel free to post your issues at [support forum][SupportForum] 
what ever those are. Your contribution would give me a chance to improve 
this plugin.
