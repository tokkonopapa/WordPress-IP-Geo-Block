Sucuri published "[Website Hacked Trend Report][SUCURI]" and reported that 
backdoor and malware are the top 2 of infection trends in Q1 2016.

How attackers get websites hacked?

The following chart (sorry but it is based on the data in Apr. 2015) suggests 
that vulnerabilities in plugins are the top source of WordPress websites being 
exploited. It also shows that [Arbitrary File Upload][OWASP-AFU] which may 
directly cause websites hacked is the 3rd place among all the type of threats.

Now, I'm very pleased to announce that [IP Geo Block 3.0.3][IP-Geo-Block] 
has an ability to prevent those type of threats!!

### Arbitrary File Upload ###

You can find [a bunch of AFU in WPScan Vulnerability Database][WP-Vulndb].
Most cases utilized `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` as an entry point of malicious 
uploading. Some of them could be blocked by "[Zero-day Exploit Prevention]
[WP-ZEP]" but some of them could not in the previous version.

For example, the following table [reported in the past][Analysis] indicates 
that WP-ZEP could not block <abbr title="Arbitrary File Upload">AFU</abbr> 
if a plugin would provid its service for both logged-in user
(<span class="emoji">
![emoji]({{ '/img/2017-03/LockedIcon.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
</span>) and not-logged-in user
(<span class="emoji">
![emoji]({{ '/img/2017-03/UnlockedIcon.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
</span>).

[![Analysis of Attack Vectors]({{ '/img/2017-05/AnalysisAttackVectors.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
  "Analysis of Attack Vectors")][Analysis]

But now, you're safe against this type of attacks!

### New feature: Prevent malicious upload ###

By default, WordPress accepts the following [file types (or extension)]
[UPLOAD-FILES] so that a logged-in user can upload them on dashboard.

![Network Settings]({{ '/img/2017-05/UploadFileSetting.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Network Settings")

But some plugins or themes that provide uploading functionality may accept 
different file types from those which WordPress accepts. And sometimes they 
would fail to verify the file types or loose to verify user's capability.

So "**Verify capability and MIME type**" will validate the both [MIME type]
[MIMETYPE] and file extension and also user [capability][Capability] on behalf 
of those vulnerable plugins and themes.

Now you can find a new option "**Prevent malicious upload**" in "**Validation 
rule settings**" section. It enables to verify the capability (i.e. 
[`upload_files`][Capability]) and restrict the MIME types of uploading files.

![All MIME Types]({{ '/img/2017-05/AllMimeTypes.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "All MIME Types")

If this configuration is too strong for your demand, "**Verify only file 
extension**" is your 2nd choice.

After you enable this feature, you may be supprised to find some malicious 
uploading in the logs within a few days. The following picutre shows that 
the attackers attempted to upload zip file including malware targeted at 
[vulnerability of Revolution Slider][RevSlider].

![Malicious uploading in logs]({{ '/img/2017-05/MaliciousUploadRequest.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Malicious uploading in logs")

Note that you need to put `FILES` into "**$_POST keys to be recorded with their
values in logs**" at "**Record settings**" section to record the content of 
[PHP environment variable `$_FILES`][PHP-FILES] like the above picture.

![RecordSettings]({{ '/img/2017-05/RecordSettings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "RecordSettings")

#### New hook: `ip-geo-block-forbidden-upload` ####

When this plugin detects malicious uploading, the filter hook 
[`ip-geo-block-forbidden-upload`][Forbidden] is applied.

I personally utilize it to make the uploaded files immune <span class="emoji">
![emoji](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f489.png)
</span> from public access and investigate them to study how websites would be 
exploited <span class="emoji">
![emoji](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f48a.png)
</span>.

If you want to use this feature, do it at your own risk!

### New feature: "Response code" on front-end ###

From this release, you can configure "**Response code**" independently on 
front-end. This is useful not to violate your affiliate program.

![Front-end target settings]({{ '/img/2017-05/FrontendSettings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Front-end target settings")

### Improvement: Enabling/Disabling "DNS reverse lookup" ###

Before this release, if "[**UA string and qualification**][Qualify]" at 
"**Front-end target settings**" includes `HOST` as follows, then DNS reverse 
lookup would be fetched. This potentially caused [504 Gateway error][504Error] 
because the cost of looking up DNS record would be relatively high.

{% highlight text %}
Google:HOST,bot:HOST,slurp:HOST
spider:HOST,archive:HOST,*:FEED
embed.ly:HOST,Twitterbot:US,Facebot:US
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to inhibit fetching DNS record, you had to change `HOST` to `*` 
as follows:

{% highlight text %}
Google:*,bot:*,slurp:*
spider:*,archive:*,*:FEED
embed.ly:*,Twitterbot:US,Facebot:US
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can just check/uncheck "**DNS reverse lookup**" to enable/disable it.

![DNS reverse Lookup]({{ '/img/2017-05/DNSLookup.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "DNS reverse Lookup")

When it is disabled, then `HOST` and `HOST=...` will be converted to `*`.

Note that `*:HOST=yahoo.com` or `*#HOST=badbot.com` for example will be 
eliminated because those will be turned into `*:*` or `*#*` that accepts 
or blocks all the user agents <span class="emoji">
