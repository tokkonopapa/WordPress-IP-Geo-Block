In WordPress 4.4 and later, `system.multicall` [XML-RPC callback is disabled]
[Core#34336] since [Sucuri][Sucuri] had discovered [brute force amplification 
attacks][BruteXMLRPC] using this callback which can attempt thousands of 
authentification only by a single HTTP request. Thanks to the core team, we 
don't need to worry about this type of attacks. But we still need to take care 
of the side issue of [DoS attack][DoS-Attack] that causes exhausting of our 
server resources.

### XML-RPC system.multicall ###

Since the core team wants to make WordPress be compliant to the [specification 
of XML-RPC][XMLRPC-SPEC], the core class processes all the methods in the 
`system.multicall`.

For example, if 10 methods in `system.multicall` require 10 times of 
authentication, and if the first one fails, the WordPress core class is smart 
to make all the subsequent methods fail, but still responds to the each request 
as follows:

{% highlight xml %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<methodResponse>
  <params>
    <param>
      <value>
        <array>
          <data>
            <value>
              <struct>
                <member>
                  <name>faultCode</name>
                  <value>
                    <int>403</int>
                  </value>
                </member>
                <member>
                  <name>faultString</name>
                  <value>
                    <string>Incorrect username or password.</string>
                  </value>
                </member>
              </struct>
            </value>
            <!-- Repeated 9 times same as the above fault instance here -->
          </data>
        </array>
      </value>
    </param>
  </params>
</methodResponse>
{% endhighlight %}

This behavior is the same even if you use [Disable XML-RPC][DIS-XMLRPC] plugin 
or add the following code into your `functions.php`.

{% highlight ruby startinline %}
add_filter( 'xmlrpc_enabled', '__return_false' );
{% endhighlight %}

Definitely, we don't need to be compliant against the attackers. So from this 
release, [IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block] immidiately returns the [status code]
[Status-Code] when the authentication fails so as not to wastefully spend our 
server resources.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Note:</strong>
  The valid authentication in <code>system.multicall</code> will be processed 
  in order. But once the illegal authentication is fetched, this plugin counts 
  up the "<strong>number of login fails</strong>" with the corresponded IP 
  address. And if it reaches to the "<strong>Maximum number of login 
  attempts</strong>", then this plugin will block any requests to the back-end 
  from that IP address.
</div>

### XML-RPC "Completely close" ###

Now you can select "**Completely close**" for XML-RPC at "**Validation target 
settings**" on "**Settings**" tab.

![XML-RPC completely close]({{ '/img/2016-02/CompletelyClose.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "XML-RPC completely close"
)

Same reason as the previous section, this feature will block more effectively 
than [Disable XML-RPC][DIS-XMLRPC] plugin.

![system.multicall in Logs]({{ '/img/2016-02/LogXML-RPC.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "system.multicall in Logs"
)

#### Benchmark ####

I updated the [ApacheBench test script][AB-TEST] to measure load of 
broute-force amplification attacks by XML-RPC `sys.multicall` which includes 
one hundred pairs of username and password. The test environment is almost 
same as [previous test][Ver2.2.2] but install [Disable XML-RPC][DIS-XMLRPC] 
plugin ("**DXR**" in the following table) by way of comparison.

<div class="table-responsive">
	<table class="table">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>DXR</th>
				<th>IGB</th>
				<th class="text-right">Requests/sec</th>
				<th class="text-right">Time/req [ms]</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>OFF</td>
				<td>OFF</td>
				<td class="text-right">5.64</td>
				<td class="text-right">177.395</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>ON</td>
				<td>OFF</td>
				<td class="text-right">5.67</td>
				<td class="text-right">176.217</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>OFF</td>
				<td>Completely close</td>
				<td class="text-right">6.63</td>
				<td class="text-right">150.784</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>OFF</td>
				<td>Block by country</td>
				<td class="text-right">6.84</td>
				<td class="text-right">146.269</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
</div>

The reason why "**Block by country**" is better than "**Completely close**" is 
that the former has less filter hook. Anyway, IP Geo Block can cut a little 
less than 20% of the server load.

### Changing the "Maximum number of login attempts" ###

You can also become to control the "**Max number of failed login attempts per 
IP address**" which was fixed as 5 by default in the previous version.

![Limit login attempts]({{ '/img/2016-02/LimitLoginAttempts.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Limit login attempts"
)

The smaller number you choose, the lower risk of breaking authentication you 
get.

![Login error page]({{ '/img/2016-02/LoginError.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Login error page"
)

### Fallback at activation ###

This plugin needs write permission on `wp-content` or 
`wp-content/plugins/ip-geo-block` where the class library 
"[`ip-geo-api`][IP-GEO-API]" is installed at activation phase. But some of 
the servers does not permit this by means of [PHP safe mode][SafeMode] or 
something similar ways mainly for the security reason. In this case, the 
previsous version fails to download the geo-location databases from 
[MaxMind][MaxMind] and [IP2Location][IP2Location]. But this was not good 
because some users need to grant permission manually.

This issue was reported at the [support forum][ISSUE-HORST]. (Thanks to 
[hai3009][HAI3009]. He made a great effort to identify the cause.)

So in this release, `wp-content/uploads` where every WordPress has write 
permission will be adopted instead of `wp-content` and 
`wp-content/plugins/ip-geo-block` if those were not writable.

A possible case is that whole `wp-content/uploads` is mapped to CDN. If you 
have a trouble in such a case, please [change the directory with filter hook]
[API-HOOK] and [give it proper permission][Permission].

### Graph of "Blocked per day" ###

In addition to the pie chart at "**Blocked by countries**" on "**Statistics**" 
tab, the Graph of "**Blocked per day**" for the last 30 days has been added.

![Blocked per day]({{ '/img/2016-02/BlockPerDay.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Blocked per day"
)

### Bug fix: Jetpack Bulk Actions ###

On the settings page of Jetpack, "**Activation**" and "**Deactivation**" by 
"**Apply**" button didn't work because this plugin would block the request.
Now this bug was fixed in this release.

![Jetpack Bulk Action]({{ '/img/2016-02/JetpackBulkAction.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Jetpack Bulk Action"
)

### Conclusion ###

Thanks to my users, the "**Active Installs**" is now 6000+. At every revision 
I released, I've dedicated to keep this plugin so simple enough to make you 
relaxed <span class="emoji">
![emoji](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f60c.png)
</span> against to the attacks.

If you have something to say all about this plugin, please feel free to open 
your issue at [support forum][FORUM]. At any time, I'm open to your suggestions.
