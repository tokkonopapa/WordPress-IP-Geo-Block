In WordPress 4.4 and later, `system.multicall` [XML-RPC callback is disabled]
[Core#34336] since [Sucuri][Sucuri] had discovered [brute force amplification 
attacks][XMLRPC-Amp] using this callback which can attempt thousands of 
authentification only by a single HTTP request. Thanks to the core team, we 
don't need to worry about this type of attacks. But we still need to take care 
of the side issue of [DoS attack][DoS-Attack] that causes exhausting of our 
server resources.

### XML-RPC system.multicall ###

Since the core team wants to make WordPress be compliant to the [specification 
of XML-RPC][XMLRPC-SPEC], the core class processes all the methods in the 
`system.multicall`.

For example, if 10 methods in `system.multicall` require 10 times of 
authentication, and if the first one fails, the WordPress core class is smart 
to make all the subsequent methods fail, but still responds to the each request 
as follows:

{% highlight xml %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<methodResponse>
  <params>
    <param>
      <value>
        <array>
          <data>
            <value>
              <struct>
                <member>
                  <name>faultCode</name>
                  <value>
                    <int>403</int>
                  </value>
                </member>
                <member>
                  <name>faultString</name>
                  <value>
                    <string>Incorrect username or password.</string>
                  </value>
                </member>
              </struct>
            </value>
            <!-- Repeated 9 times same as the above fault instance here -->
          </data>
        </array>
      </value>
    </param>
  </params>
</methodResponse>
{% endhighlight %}

This behavior is the same even if you use [Disable XML-RPC][DIS-XMLRPC] plugin 
or add the following code into your `functions.php`.

{% highlight php %}
add_filter( 'xmlrpc_enabled', '__return_false' );
{% endhighlight %}

Definitely, we don't need to be compliant against the attackers. So from this 
release, [IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block] immidiately returns the [status code]
[Status-Code] when the authentication fails so as not to wastefully spend our 
server resources.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Note:</strong>
  If every information for authentication in <code>system.multicall</code> is 
  valid, those will be processed successfully. This behavior is the same as 
  the core class. On the other hand, if one of the authentication fails, this 
  plugin counts up the "<strong>number of login fails</strong>" with the 
  corresponded IP address. If it reaches to the "<strong>Maximum number of 
  login attempts</strong>", then this plugin will block any requests to the 
  back-end from that IP address.
</div>

### XML-RPC "Completely close" ###

Now you can select "**Completely close**" for XML-RPC at "**Validation target 
settings**" on "**Settings**" tab.

![XML-RPC completely close]({{ '/img/2016-02/CompletelyClose.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "XML-RPC completely close"
)

Same reason as the previous section, this feature will block more effectively 
than [Disable XML-RPC][DIS-XMLRPC] plugin.

![system.multicall in Logs]({{ '/img/2016-02/LogXML-RPC.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "system.multicall in Logs"
)

#### Benchmark ####

I updated the [ApacheBench test script][AB-TEST] to measure load of 
broute-force amplification attacks by XML-RPC `sys.multicall` which includes 
one hundred pairs of username and password. The test environment is almost 
same as [previous test][Ver2.2.2] but install [Disable XML-RPC][DIS-XMLRPC] 
plugin ("**DXR**" in the following table) by way of comparison.

<div class="table-responsive">
	<table class="table">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>DXR</th>
				<th>IGB</th>
				<th class="text-right">Requests/sec</th>
				<th class="text-right">Time/req [ms]</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>OFF</td>
				<td>OFF</td>
				<td class="text-right">5.64</td>
				<td class="text-right">177.395</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>ON</td>
				<td>OFF</td>
				<td class="text-right">5.67</td>
				<td class="text-right">176.217</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>OFF</td>
				<td>Completely close</td>
				<td class="text-right">6.63</td>
				<td class="text-right">150.784</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>OFF</td>
				<td>Block by country</td>
				<td class="text-right">6.84</td>
				<td class="text-right">146.269</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
</div>

The reason why "**Block by country**" is better than "**Completely close**" is 
that the former has less filter hook. Anyway, IP Geo Block can cut a little 
less than 20% of the server load.

### Changing the "Maximum number of login attempts" ###

You can also become to control the "**Max number of failed login attempts per 
IP address**" which was fixed as 5 by default in the previous version.

![Limit login attempts]({{ '/img/2016-02/LimitLoginAttempts.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Limit login attempts"
)

The smaller number you choose, the lower risk of breaking authentication you 
get.

Note that currently login error page is not user friendly. For example, if you 
choose "0" as for the number, and you would fail to login, you still stay at 
login page. When you revisit at (or refresh) the login page, you get the 
status code of `403 Forbidden` or something.

![Login error page]({{ '/img/2016-02/LoginError.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Login error page"
)


### Graph of "Blocked per day" ###

In addition to the pie chart at "**Blocked by countries**" on "**Statistics**" 
tab, the Graph of "**Blocked per day**" for the last 30 days has been added.

### Conclusion ###

At every revision I released, I've dedicated to keep this plugin so simple 
enough to make you relaxed <span class="emoji">
![emoji](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f60c.png)
</span> against to the attacks. As for this release, only 10 lines of code 
have been added into the core class of this plugin including a few lines of 
comments. On the other hand, I think I should keep improving the UI and UX 
more user friendly especially on the dashboard.

But if you have something to say all about this plugin, please feel free to 
open your issue at [support forum][Forum]. At any time, I'm open to your 
suggestions. <span class="emoji">
