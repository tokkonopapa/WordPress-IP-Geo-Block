In this release, I should fix some blocking issue to make it compatible with 
verious plugins and themes.

### Admin lock out by brute-force attack with same IP ###

At [support forum][IssueLockOut] I got an issue which caused self blocking 
right after this plugin's upgrade from 2.2.9.1 to 3.0.0. It seemed to be 
caused by the reason "**Limited**" which means:

> The number of login attempts reached to the limit.

Theoretically, it could be if the dynamically assigned IP address was shared 
between admin and attacker. But of course, it's almost unlikely to happen.

So I examined http load testing on my local server in order to emulate 
brute-force attacks using [Apache Bench command][ApacheBench] at about 700 
requests per minute. I had done it dozens of times and I had only one 
unreasonable error which was:

{% highlight ruby %}
PHP Warning: call_user_func_array() expects parameter 1 to be a valid callback, class 'IP_Geo_Block_Logs' does not have a method 'exec_sql' in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/wp-includes/class-wp-hook.php on line 298
{% endhighlight %}

I also tested the previous version 2.2.9.1 as same number of sets and I got 
a quite reasonable error:

{% highlight ruby %}
WordPress database error Deadlock found when trying to get lock; try restarting transaction for query DELETE FROM `wp_ip_geo_block_logs` WHERE `hook` = 'login' ORDER BY `No` ASC LIMIT 1 made by require('wp-load.php'), require_once('wp-config.php'), require_once('wp-settings.php'), include_once('/mu-plugins/ip-geo-block-mu.php'), IP_Geo_Block::get_instance, IP_Geo_Block->__construct, IP_Geo_Block_Loader->run, call_user_func, IP_Geo_Block->validate_login, IP_Geo_Block->validate_ip, IP_Geo_Block_Logs::record_logs, IP_Geo_Block_Logs::add_sql, QM_DB->query
{% endhighlight %}

The difference between those two version related to this issue is the timing 
when to write the cached IP address into the MySQL DB which command would be 
issued just before responding the attacker in 2.2.9.1 while just at [shutdown 
action hook][ShutdownHook] in 3.0.0.

So I decided to revise the timing in 3.0.0 back to the same as 2.2.9.1. I can 
not say this change would fix the issue for certain, but I should do it.

#### Prevent blocking ####

In this release, when the above issue happens, you can see the following 
warning message on admin dashboard:

![Dashboard message]({{ '/img/2016-12/dashboard-message.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Dashboard message"
)

Once this happens, please go to "**Statistics**" tab of IP Geo Block settings 
page and execute "**Clear cache**" to resolve blocking.

### Installation information ###

When you unfortunately encount blocking while you're logged in, you'll see the 
following window if you don't setup a [human friendly error page][FriendlyPage]:

![Blocking message]({{ '/img/2016-12/forbidden-message.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Blocking message"
)

The "**Dashboard**" is a safe zone so that you'll never be blocked.

As you know, this plugin potencially have some blocking issues that should 
be improved. When you meet them, please find "**Installation information**" 
section at the bottom of the this plugin's option page and push "**Show 
information**" button!

![Installation information]({{ '/img/2016-12/install-info.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Installation information"
)

This button gathers some useful information so that you can copy &amp; paste 
and easily submit your issue at [support forum][SupportForum]. Please feel 
free to use it. I always appreciate you to let me know these infomations
